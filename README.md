# fllappyy bird game 
This project successfully demonstrates the development of a Flappy Bird-style game using core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—while also exploring the capabilities and challenges of using a dedicated game engine like melonJS. Key game features such as real-time collision detection, background changes, sound integration, and score tracking were effectively implemented. Although some issues were encountered, especially with game rendering in melonJS during restarts, these challenges provided valuable learning experiences in debugging, framework configuration, and asset management. Overall, the project enhanced practical understanding of game loops, event handling, and browser-based game design, laying a strong foundation for future game development endeavors.
